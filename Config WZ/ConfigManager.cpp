 * These files may not contain general SETTINGS. The first config file (directly in the Language
 *   folder) must contain basic language information (like the id). All other config files must be in
 *   immediate sub-directories; beyond that, the structure is arbitrary. For example, we load "Burglish"
 *   and "Zawgyi Input" in separate folders, but we load a series of "Standard Transformers" all from
 *   one directory.
 * These files are optional, but heavily encouraged in all distributions except the Web Demo.

 *   WaitZar config options where applicable.
 * WaitZar's GUI config window will alter this file. Loading it is optional, but it's generally a good idea

 * This is the file that users will tweak on their own. It is HIGHLY recommended to load this file, if it exists.
