#Add all words according to the following notation:
# mm = roman
# where mm is the word in Burmese, in the encoding of your choice (Zawgyi for now)
# ...and roman is the romanisation of that word. For example:
#အား = ar
#ဣတ္ = ate

#Words reported by our users
ဆီမ့္ = seint

#Words which cannot be added to the model, as they already have a standard romanisation.
ဖုိင္ = file

#Convenience (shortcut) words
မဂၤလာပါ = mingalarpar
ေယာက္်ား = yaukyarr
