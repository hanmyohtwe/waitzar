// This is because most of its functionality is of direct benefit to the
//   Windows build, so we hope to test its correctness through the next
//   two Windows releases of WaitZar. 
// Since there is some universally-useful code here, we will eventually
//   include this in both releases, but we want to avoid bumping libwaitzar's
//   major revision for breakages caused by code that wasn't originally intended
//   for Linux to begin with.

	 * Sort a unicode string according to the rules defined in UTN-11 and K. Soe Min's blog.
	 *  Works in-place, and has a complexity of O(size(uniString)), single-pass
	 *  Any non-Myanmar letters are ignored (technically, they cause the sorter to reset, which is expected)
	 * We do not sort stacked letters together; rather, we sort U+1039 separately and then re-start the 
	 *  algorithm when the stacked consonant is encountered. This requires special care to be taken for kinzi.
	 * We assume that U+103A and U+1039 (and consonants, and kinzi) are always properly ordered.
	 *  We ignore "visible virama" and treat it always like "asat". This is done because it is equivalent for
	 *  most cases, and exceptions seem to render properly. We will revise this if we find any glaring inconsistencies.
