Note! This directory contains OLD source code files. 
We'll eventually be merging these into win32_src/contrib, and performing all development from there.

 * This is because we're migrating to Eclipse, and I want to have the same source in the same place on Windows and Linux.
 * PythonSpecs.cpp hasn't been moved yet. Need to figure out a good way of doing this.
