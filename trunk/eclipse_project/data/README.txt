This folder contains the WaitZar corpus, licensed like the rest of the project (Apache 2, as of 2010).

The files contain the following:
  Corpus.book.txt - A book.
  Corpus.forums.txt - Various forum posts from Planet Myanmar.
  Corpus.news.txt - Various news articles from an online magazine.
  Corpus.syllables.txt - A list of "all Burmese syllables" (we think it's missing some).

Finally:
  Corpus.combined.txt - All of the above (except "syallables"???), with hyphens separating each syllable. 
  
Notes:
  * These files use the Zawgyi-One encoding.
  * We cleaned up the forum posts to remove spelling errors, but I'm sure a lot remain.
