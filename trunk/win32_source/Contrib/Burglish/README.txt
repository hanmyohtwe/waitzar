Source Code Location: ..\..\..\cross_platform_library\waitzar\burglish
How to Include:  #include "Burglish/(file).h"

Changes made for WaitZar:
   * Wrapped in a "waitzar" namespace tag.
   * Added macros to workaround size differences between wchar_t on 
     Linux and Windows.
   * This fork will NOT be regularly maintained or updated; each update requries 
     too much quality control to make it worthwhile, and it already works 
     well enough for our purposes.
