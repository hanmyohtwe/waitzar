#Add all words according to the following notation:
# mm = roman
# where mm is the word in Burmese, in the encoding of your choice (Zawgyi for now)
# ...and roman is the romanisation of that word. For example:
#အား = ar
#ဣတ္ = ate

#Words reported by our users (will be incorporated into the main dictionary later).
ဆီမ့္ = seint
ခြန္႔ = khont
ခစ္ = khit

#Words which cannot be added to the model, as they already have a standard romanisation.
# These will be included perpetually for convenience
ဖုိင္ = file
ဥစ္ = oait
ဥ = ou

#Added as a reminder to make patsint words easier to type
