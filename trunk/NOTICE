The Zawgyi-One Font: Version 3.14
 Zawgyi-One is a curious font; its copyright belongs to Zawgyi.net and Alpha Mandalay.
 However, it is distributed with no licensing information, and is thus classified and 
 redistributable under the terms of license-free software. The Zawgyi.net website has
 stated in a front-page article that Zawgyi-One is and will always be free. 
 The Wait Zar project sees fonts like Zawgyi-One as an enabling technology, and sees no 
 legal need to request special permission to embed or redistribute such fonts, so long
 as credit is duly given and links to the latest versions of such fonts are provided.
 We would encourage members of the Alpha Myanmar team to contact us directly if they
 have any questions or requests.
