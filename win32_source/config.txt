# If "yes", each typed word becomes part of a phrase; the user
#  must type "Space" again to enter the entire phrase. The benefit of doing it this way is 
#  that Wait Zar can "figure out" what word you want based on the previous words.
# Also, you can use the arrow keys to move left/right between words, like a mini text editor.
