#You should be able to turn this directly into a PNG chunk, with all the necessary PulpCoreFont information
#Numbers are in hex values
#Note that "3C" as a final letter means there are "3D" total letters --and one final "char_position" at the end.
#Letters are arranged via a one-to-one mapping to their keys; duplicates are allowed, to make this simpler

#PNG chunk: length, chunk_type
#length (not including type, I think
# length = short*3 + byte + byte*8 + short*(chars+1)
#        = 143, in our case (8F)
#....and, forgot there's a CRC at the end.
