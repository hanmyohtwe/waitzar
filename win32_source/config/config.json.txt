##NOTE: Old config settings; make sure to handle these in code before release WZ 1.8:
#silencemywordserrors = no
#ballooononstart = yes
#alwayselevate = no
#trackcaret = yes
#lockwindows = yes
#burmesenumerals = yes

{
    # General settings. To override these, edit the file:
	#   waitzar.config.json.txt
	# ...located in your "Documents" or "My Documents" folder.
	#
	# You can override a single setting by appending the "settings" prefix and a period to it, e.g.:
	#   "settings.hotkey" : "Ctrl + M"
	# For most simple configuration options, "yes" or "no" will suffice. Alternatively, "y" or "true" may be used
	#  to mean "yes", and "n" or "false" may be used to mean "no".

      #   "Ctrl" , "Alt", or "Shift"
      # One of the following keys must appear as the final key press:
      #   "Space" or any letter key or any modifier (letter keys are case-insensitive)
      # Some examples:
      #   "Ctrl + M"
      #   "Ctrl + Alt + Space"
